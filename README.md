# Wave Portal 

This is a web3 app with a front end built in React and a smart contract built in Solidity. 

It allows users to submit 'waves' through the UI, which are then stored on the blockchain. 

The contract is currently deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. 

There is a 50% chance that a 'waver' is rewarded with some Rinkeby test ETH. 

This app was built by following Buildspace's Solidity/Ethereum course - https://buildspace.so/solidity.

## Front end 
- React 

## Back end 
- Hardhat
